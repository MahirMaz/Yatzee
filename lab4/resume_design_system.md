# Homer Simpson Design System 

## 1. Color Palette
I implemented a very light and basic color palette so that the background would make the page less visually busy.
- **Primary Color**: 
- **Text Color**: #333
- **Background Color**: #f8f8f8 (box background color)
- **Border Color**: #e0e0e0 (slight shadow effect)

**Background**
Used a jpg image of a sky with clouds in reference to the Simpsons

## 2. Typography
- **Font Family**: 'Calibri', sans-serif
- **Font Color**: #333

## 3. Components and Layout

## Container
The body is locked into a container to give the website a "paper" like aesthetic similar to a physical resume.

## Content Boxes
Title, About Me, Education, Employment History all use the same boxes
Separated to add color from the background as well as divides sections of the pages

## Header
- **Profile Picture**
- **Name**
- **Occupation / Title** 
- **Social Icons** 

## Social Icons
Facebook, Linkedin, and Twitter icons with the same aesthetic and are clickable.

## About Me and Address
Split them horizontally to make the page look less narrow and one dimensional

## Education
Gave Education a separate section 

## Employment History 
Made sure to keep each category visually different:
**Job Title**: Dark
